# DCGANnetwork-in-pictures
Another type of GAN, using Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Nerworks.

## Introduction

 - The structure is based on Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Nerworks, worked on TensorFlow.
 
 - The whole training takes much time and calculation amount, maybe you'd better use GPU version or you will have to wait for a long time training.
 
 - Another choice is that you can download the trained model by me. I will upload the model trained from Celeb's 10000 face pictures.
 
 - In ``DCGAN_64x64.py``, used as the structure:

 while in ``DCGAN_32x32.py``, I reduce one layer so the output is 32x32x3 pic.
 
 
 - Here is the hyperparameter:

Then there I recorded the training process in 4 kind of training dataset:

The results using fully connected network is:

while using this DCGAN is :

Here is the results in different training dataset:

 - On drawing figure face:

 - On car pictures:

 - On human face pictures:

 - On coins:

there is much difference, right?
*********************

## How to use

 - Put all datasets in to a folder and change the ``input_data`` content to your dataset folder, After it trained, you can turn off To_Train button and run it again it will create pictures generated by the generator.

 - I will uploaded trained model to the folder `` 训练完成的模型 ``, whose name represent the dataset's type I trained. 
 Also, I will put the hyperparameter txt in it so that you should keep yours same to that and you can use it.

__I strongly recommend to use 64x64 code for I have updated it in continuing training and learning rate decay, and the model I upload will be that code.__
